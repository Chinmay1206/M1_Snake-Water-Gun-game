# State Of Art/ Research

Snake Water Gun is one of the famous two-player game played by many people. It is a hand game in which the player randomly chooses any of the three forms i.e. snake, water, and gun. Here, we are going to implement this game using C .

# High Level Requirements
 
<li> It consists of the declaration of the variables. </li>
<li> printf() and scanf() functions for displaying the content and taking input from the user. It also contains  two predefined functions:</li>
<li> srand() and rand() which are used to generate random numbers in the range [0, RAND_MAX) and srand() especially will help to generate a random number at each time.</li>
<li> Take modulo of random number generated with 100 to make its range between (0 and 100).</li>
<li> As the range is up to 100 only, the distribution among all the options i.e., Snake Water & Gun is equal as all of them have an equal probability of coming.</li>

# Low Level Requirements

<li> USer have to guess the input Sanke(S), Water(W), Gun(G) </li>
