# Identifying Features

<li>Screen guides how to enter the details.</li>
<li>Very friendly interface and even children can use it.</li>
<li>State Of Art/ Research</li>
<li>Snake Water Gun is one of the famous two-player game played by many people. It is a hand game in which the player randomly chooses any of the three forms i.e. snake, water, and gun. Here, we are going to implement this game using C .

This C project is to build a game for a single player that plays with the computer</li>

4W'S & 1H
WHO
<li>One can be used it as a fun game to in his/her free time.</li>

WHAT
<li>This idea is used to play with computer.</li>

WHEN
<li>Whenever the user wants to play.</li>

WHY
<li>The project uses simple function and compact to work.</li>

HOW
<li>By implementin multilevel program it can be achieved and this project requires low cost of development.</li>

# High Level Requirements
<li>It consists of the declaration of the variables.</li>
<li>printf() and scanf() functions for displaying the content and taking input from the user. It also contains two predefined functions:
srand() and rand() which are used to generate random numbers in the range [0, RAND_MAX) and srand() especially will help to generate a random number at each time.
<li>Take modulo of random number generated with 100 to make its range between (0 and 100).</li>
<li>As the range is up to 100 only, the distribution among all the options i.e., Snake Water & Gun is equal as all of them have an equal probability of coming.</li>
# Low Level Requirements
<li> USer have to guess the input Sanke(S), Water(W), Gun(G)</li>

# Best Methods
<li>To avoid conclusion</li>
